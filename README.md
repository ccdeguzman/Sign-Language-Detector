# Sign-Language-Detector
    
    A personal project

    I wanted to teach myelf the basic of American Sign Language by learning its alphabet so I implemented a project that would help me do exactly that.
    I took 7,200 images, 300 per letter across the 24 ASL alphabet, and uploaded them to Google's Teachable Machine, creating a machine learning model.

    Next Steps:
        - Adding detection for letters J and Z since they require hand motions and the current project only allows still hand gestures to be detected.
            - Adding this feature could lead to recognizing actions in sign language 
        - More diversed still images. I think it would help with detecting the hand gestures more accurately.
        - Adding more features such as a section where the user can be tested - check on learning.
